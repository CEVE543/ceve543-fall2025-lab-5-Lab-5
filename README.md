# Lab 5: Regional Pooling Implementation

**Date:** September 26, 2025 | **Module:** 1 | **Week:** 5

## Overview

This lab explores hierarchical Bayesian modeling approaches for regional frequency analysis. Students will implement and compare different pooling strategies, understand the bias-variance trade-offs inherent in these approaches, and observe how partial pooling creates shrinkage effects that balance local and regional information.

## Topics Covered

- No pooling vs complete vs partial pooling strategies
- Bias-variance trade-offs in regional frequency analysis
- Shrinkage effects in hierarchical models
- Hierarchical Bayesian model implementation
- Regional homogeneity assessment

## Objectives

- Implement hierarchical Bayesian models with different pooling strategies
- Understand bias-variance trade-offs in regional frequency analysis
- Observe shrinkage effects in partial pooling models
- Compare the performance of different pooling approaches

## Connection to Problem Sets

This lab provides the hierarchical Bayesian modeling tools that students will use for PS1 Task 5, enabling sophisticated regional analysis that leverages information from multiple stations while respecting local variability.
